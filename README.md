# Graphs-And-Euler-Circle
This is a final project in the "Algorithms" course. The project deals with the problem of "finding an Euler circle in a directed or undirected graph".
The program uses data structures to store the information such as: vertices, arcs, degrees and more.
The efficiency of the program is linear O(N+M), where N= the number of vertices in the graph and M= the number of arcs in the graph.
In this program I used the DFS algorithm to find ties.
The project was written in C++ language.
More information is in the attached PDF file.
